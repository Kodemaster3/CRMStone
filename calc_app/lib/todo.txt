            add weight in component           +
            remove from component all units   +
            add unitWeight in order           +

in ui:      optimised layer
            add Login Screen                    +
            implement Create Account            -

in data & case:
            implement material with isolation of orders                 +
            implement choose all layer material in component!!!         +
            separate blocs case order, component, material              Â±
            move mapper to domain/mapper                                +
            implement bloc login local, for test                        -!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
            implement bloc login with firebase login, out, create, del  -

          !!  when material use in component, and material is deleted, need implement logic, this component when it reed,
            must give proposition to chose material from list
          !!  when create component and list material is empty, user see toast to create minimum one material



            implement ui material                                       +
            must be adding Surface Area                                 -
