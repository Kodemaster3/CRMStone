implement:
1. model entities from domain in data layer               -is done!
2. add use case by logic with order and sub components    -in done!
3. repository must work by use case                       -is done!
4. add splash screen
5. create any like design for ui                          -in progress
6. add login screen after splash fireBase 



in entity:  add dateTime/                     +

            add description in component/     +
            add unit_linear/                  +
            add unit_weight in size           +
            add weight in component           +
            remove from component all units   +
            add unitWeight in order           +

in ui:      optimised layer


in data & case:
            implement material with isolation of orders             -in progress
            move all mapper logic in use case??
            separate blocs case order, component, material



            implement bloc material/usecase
